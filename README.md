# Toppreise Preferred Vendor Highlighter

A Tampermonkey user script for Toppreise.ch that improves the shopping experience by highlighting your preferred vendors and cleaning up the interface.

## Features

Highlight Preferred Vendors: Offers from vendors with a "filled star" (your favorites) get a distinct green border and subtle background tint.

Dampen Others: Standard offers are slightly faded (greyed out) to reduce visual noise, but return to full visibility when you hover over them.

Clean Layout: Hides the redundant "Favorite Shops" box at the top of the results to save vertical space.

Dynamic Loading: Works automatically when sorting, filtering, or loading more results.
